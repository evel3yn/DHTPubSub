# DHTPubSub
DHT Register/Lookup in Publish-Subscribe using ZMQ and Mininet
In this assignment we will build upon Assignment #1. Keep all the properties supported by the publishers and subscribers from assignment #1 including the QoS properties. However, this time we will do things a bit differently by using a DHT ring of event services instead of a single, centralized event service. Publishers and subscribers will use register to send their topics and offered and requested QoS to any one of the DHT nodes they know of. The DHT logic should then route it to the correct DHT ring event service, which then stores the info.
You have two choices in doing the information dissemination. If you want to use the event service, the publisher will just send its publication to the event service node that was responsible for registering it. You should know this from the return value of the register () message. That event service then sends the info to the registered subscribers. Alternately, subscribers can do a “lookup” for a publisher who satisfies their needs and connects to that publisher under the hood (as part of the middleware layer). But you will need to handle failures of publishers.
Python has a package called hash_ring, which you can install using pip. Hash ring implements consistent hashing. Please see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hash_ring for a simple sample code on how to use the hash function.

This project consistes of three files: pulisher.py, DHTServer.py, subscriber.py
